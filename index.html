        <p>In your imagination you can go anywhere you want. We'll put some happy little leaves here and there. If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better.</p>

        <p>It all happens automatically. Talent is a pursued interest. That is to say, anything you practice you can do. You need the dark in order to show the light. Work that paint. You don't have to be crazy to do this but it does help. Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at?</p>
        
        <p>You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen. I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school.</p>
        
        <p>I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good.</p>
        
        <p>Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall. Clouds are free. They just float around the sky all day and have fun. Isn't that fantastic? If there's two big trees invariably sooner or later there's gonna be a little tree.</p>
        
        <p>Let's just drop a little Evergreen right here. We don't really know where this goes - and I'm not sure we really care. Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away.</p>
        
        <p>Maybe we got a few little happy bushes here, just covered with snow. At home you have unlimited time. You can spend all day playing with mountains. Just think about these things in your mind - then bring them into your world.</p>
